CBEFF, or the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework, is a propriatary
standard used to store and sign biometric information. This is used most
commonly with FIPS 201 PIV smartcards. This implements the out-of-date CBEFF
spec that's used by Federal smartcards. This format is a legay and highly
complex storage format, and it's main purpose is to extract information
to common and interchangeable formats where possible.
